# Z-Image-Turbo-DMDR-Speed-Preserved-Fine-tuning-via-DMDR-without-Auxiliary-LoRA
This project provides a high-fidelity implementation of the DMDR loss function tailored for Z-Image-Turbo. We introduce an "Aux-LoRA-Free" training pipeline that enables Reinforcement Learning and SFT/LoRA fine-tuning without extra training overhead, ensuring crystal-clear generation and zero inference speed penalty.
